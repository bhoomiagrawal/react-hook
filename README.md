Learn React Hook

A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, 

*useState* - is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.
If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. We’re going to do that right now!

*useEffect* - By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

*Custom Hook* - You can build your own hook, 
A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.
I've created custom hook named "useTitle".
